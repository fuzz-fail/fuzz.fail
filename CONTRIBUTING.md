# Contributing to fuzz.fail

All contributions to this site fall under the [license at the root of this repository](LICENSE).

## AI Contributions

Contributions relying entirely upon generative AI will be outright rejected.
These tools should only ever be used in an editorial capacity, but preferably not at all.

## Contribution Categorization

There are four main categories: content, context, template, or editorial.

_Content_ contributions add papers or questions to this site, without additional context.
This allows us to simply assemble summaries and pose open questions without necessarily having online discussion about those papers.
Papers should be limited to those accepted by peer-reviewed venues.
Authors may contribute their own papers.

_Context_ contributions add context to papers or questions.
That means links to online discussions, related papers (preferably links within the site), or self-made work.
Self-made work which is not in a peer-reviewed venue will be subject to an impromptu open peer-review by site maintainers.

_Template_ contributions modify the website's actual templating.
This should be mostly for fixing accessibility problems or updating the website.

_Editorial_ contributions are strictly for fixing language, figure, or data errors.
Major edits which fundamentally change the semantics of a previous contribution should be their own _context_ contributions.
