# fuzz.fail

A community-assembled project for aggregating public information regarding questions in fuzzing (and search-based testing strategies on its periphery).

## Why?

Fuzzing is a notoriously difficult thing to get right.
Papers do and say one thing, and later efforts to reproduce or reimplement fail for one reason or another.
This is rarely a function of malice; fuzzer evaluations are easy to get wrong in subtle ways, and the current paper and artifact review processes are simply not equipped to find these errors.

Similarly, there is a lot of sentiment that fuzzing is somehow "over", that there are no more questions to solve.
This is somewhat true -- for the low-hanging fruit.
Reviewers are starting to become more prudent, and what remains is technically and theoretically challenging.
There are many questions left to solve.

Thus: [fuzz.fail](https://fuzz.fail).
This site will serve two purposes: the aggregation of online resources which further explore or refute academic papers or technical writings, and the enumeration of open questions in fuzzing.

### What this site will not and cannot be

This is not a name-and-blame site for throwing insults or engaging in baseless cynicism.
This is not a site which will tolerate ad hominem or in-/out-group bias.

# Call for Contributors

Look, I don't want to be The Guy™ running this website.
I think that's biased and unscientific.
If anything, I want this site to serve as something to bring more scientific discourse to our domain, which has sadly gained a poor reputation due to true failings of both paper writing and review.

For this reason, I would like to mix a little democracy into this site a bit.
If you are a researcher in the fuzzing domain who would like to have a say in the maintenance of this site, reach out.
I will happily add maintainership access to researchers in this domain to reduce the bus factor and ensure some level of "fairness" in the site's maintenance.
